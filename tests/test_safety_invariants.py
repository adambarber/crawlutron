"""Executable safety invariants: recurring bug classes blocked at the door.

The round-4 review's central lesson (validated empirically): static
rejection of "pathological" shapes is bypassable, and chokepoints only
hold if bypassing them fails CI instead of code review. These AST walks
verify the UNSAFE patterns are absent from app/ so reintroducing them
turns the build red.
